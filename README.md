# Tic Tac Toe Game

## Overview

This game features a classic 3x3 Tic Tac Toe board. The user starts by selecting their symbol, either X or O, while the computer automatically takes the other symbol. Once the symbol is chosen, the game board is displayed, and the user always makes the first move. The game alternates between the user and the computer until one player wins or the game ends in a draw. The result is displayed, and the user can choose to play again.
